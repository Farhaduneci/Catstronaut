## What is this repo about?
Here I began my journey building a full-stack GraphQL example application called Catstronauts, a learning platform for adventurous cats who want to explore the universe! ðŸ˜º ðŸš€

## Features list

- [X] The first feature will fetch a (mocked) list of learning tracks from a GraphQL API and display them in a card grid on our homepage.

## Demo

## How to use this repo
There are 2 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.

To get started:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server.
In another Terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
